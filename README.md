# Vigenere-Cipher-Python
Python code for vigenere encryption/decryption cipher

In Vigenere cryptography, the set of related monoalphabetic substitution rules consists of the 26 Caesar ciphers with shifts of 0 through 25. Each cipher is denoted by a key letter, which is the ciphertext letter that substitutes for the plain- text letter a. Thus, a Caesar cipher with a shift of 3 is denoted by the key value 3.

To encrypt a message, a key is needed that is as long as the message. Usually, the key is a repeating keyword. For example, if the keyword is deceptive, the mes- sage “we are discovered save yourself” is encrypted as

key: deceptivedeceptivedeceptive

plaintext: wearediscoveredsaveyourself

ciphertext: ZICVTWQNGRZGVTWAVZHCQYGLMGJ
